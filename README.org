#+title: Readme

I don't necessarily think that I can make an editor better than Emacs or Neovim. But I thought it might be fun to try nonetheless. Partially just as an exercise in learning how the whole thing works.

* Things to try
- Ropes
- Generic back-end that works with both gui and tui front-ends.
- Client/server model
- "Everything is a buffer". Make everything you do (or, as much as possible) involve editing a buffer
  - Expose interaction points for various plugins
  - Provide a unified interface for all commands.
* Necessary features
** Syntax highlighting
** Multiple buffers
** Modal editing
** LSP
* Experiments
** TODO Potential Languages
- I like Rust, and I think it's a good language to write the low-level stuff in.
- That said, I would think that it's not that good for writing plugins
- In which case, I think lua/fennel would be a good option.
- I like the idea of as many features as possible simply being plugins that ship with the editor.
- If I'm feeling extra spicy, I could try writing it in Carp.
  - I don't know if it has all the benefits of writing in a lisp due to it being compiled.
- I could also go back to my old love of Haskell.
*** TODO Try out different languages [0/5]
**** TODO Carp
**** TODO Fennel
**** TODO Rust + Lua/fennel bindings
**** TODO Haskell + lua/fennel bindings
**** TODO Unison?
** TODO Plugins
** TODO Ratatui experiment [0/2]
I'm reasonably confident that I could get an editor to work in Rust, given its community. Looking around, I found Ratatui as a good thing to base my work on - at least for initial experiments.

*** Status update 2024-01-29
I've made actual progress on the editor! You can, in fact, use it to write text. With that said, it's /very/ bare-bones. I like the ideas of Ratatui, so if I decide that Rust is the way to go with it, than it would be a good place to start with.

In terms of GUIs, I also like the look of iced. I haven't programmed in it, though, so it's a little bit up in the air. But it seems cool.

Obviously there's a lot of work in front of me. I'm not sure what even to tackle next.
*** TODO Structure in a more meaningful way
Build for growth
*** TODO Better error messages
